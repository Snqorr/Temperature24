# Temperature24
creating the temperature app
link: https://github.com/Snqorr/Temperature24.git

# Description
The sole purpose of creating this app, is so when the user wants to know the weather and the average, it can all be in one click of your finger rather then watching the whole segment of the news just waiting for the weather to pop up. the app informs users fast about the weather and can calculate the average weather to make things easier for our users. this app is important because it does not just inform you about the weather but rather teaches you on how the weather is calculated, and how convinient it is. A lot of hard work and dedication went in to create this app, because we want users to be sastisfied about the end product. Challenges were faced upon creating the app such as, the emulator not responding well, the code not working and multiple crashes when starting the app upon other things.
